What puts a database into first normal form?
10
A database is in 1NF when no columns contain multiple values per row. 

2
What puts a database into second normal form?
20
A database is in 2NF when its attributes all depend on the entirety of the primary key.

3
What puts a database into third normal form?
30
A database is in 3NF when it has a key that depends on the primary key via a non-primary key. 

4
In database theory, what is functional dependency?
40
An attribute Y is dependent on Y if any two entities with identical values of X have identical values of Y. 

5
What is the format for creating a table in Sqlite3? 
50

6
What is the format for inputing data into a table in Sqlite3?
60
INSERT INTO <tablename> VALUES(<entry>, <entry>, ... <entry>), (<entry>, <entry>, ... <entry>); 

7
what is the format for seeing some attributes from a table in Sqlite3?
70
SELECT <attribute name>, ... <attribute name> FROM <table name>;

8
What are the 7 data types in Sqlite3?
80
Int/Integer (whole numbers), text (Strings), blob (could by anything), real (floating point numbers), decimal(x,y) (a decimal number of x digits, y of which are after the decimal point), character/varchar(n) (a string of n characters/up to n characters), date/datetime (a timestamp), boolean (duh) 

9
what are the 4 constraints you can assign to attributes when creating a table in Sqlite3?
90
Not Null (attribute can't be blank), unique (no other row can have the same value), check () (run a check that it meets a condition), primary key (not null and unique)

11
How do you declare foreign and primary keys when defining a table?
110
When creating the table, re-state the primary key attributse with "PRIMARY KEY(att1, att2)" and the foreign key attribute(s) with any number of entries of FOREIGN KEY(<attribute>) REFERENCES <othertable><attribute>

12
What are the 4 (overlapping) types of key?
120
Candidate Key - minimal set of attributes that uniquely refer to an entity; Primary Key - the key we use; Composite Key - a key containing multiple attributes; Surrogate Key - a meaningless id number used for the sake of having a key.
